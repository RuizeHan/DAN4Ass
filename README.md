## Introduction
Identifying the same persons across different views plays an important role in many vision applications. In this paper, we study this important problem, denoted as Multi-view MultiHuman Association (MvMHA), on multi-view images that are taken by different cameras at the same time. Different from previous works on human association across two views, this paper is focused on more general and challenging scenarios of more than two views, and none of these views are fixed or priorly known.

In this work, we propose a Deep Assignment Network (DAN) to model the constrained multi-view multi-clique assignment problem, which is implemented by two popular backbone networks (RNN and GNN). On both of them, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised constraint loss.
